# Hobbyist Feedback Report: Glintstone Platform Design

**Perspective:** Tech professional with family, limited discretionary time, genuine interest in ancient history, no formal Assyriology training

**Time Budget:** ~5-10 hours/week hobby time, ~20 hours/year corporate volunteer allocation

---

## Executive Summary

I want to help decode humanity's ancient past. I really do. But you have about 90 seconds to convince me this is worth my precious Saturday morning, and then another 5 minutes to get me to actually do something useful. If I feel lost, overwhelmed, or like my contribution does not matter, I am gone. Here is what would make me stay.

---

## 1. Motivations and Barriers

### Why I Would Want to Contribute

**The romance of discovery.** There is something undeniably compelling about the idea that I could help decode a 4,000-year-old shopping list or letter from a worried parent. These are real human stories buried in clay. That emotional hook is powerful.

**Meaningful use of volunteer time.** My company gives me 1% time for volunteering (about 20 hours per year). I have used Zooniverse before. But scrolling through blurry whale photos gets repetitive. If you told me I could spend that time helping unlock ancient human knowledge? That is a much better pitch for my quarterly volunteer report.

**Escape from doom-scrolling.** I actively want alternatives to social media. If I could open this app instead of Reddit and feel like I accomplished something real in 10 minutes, that is genuinely appealing.

**Being part of something larger.** The stat that only 5-6% of cuneiform tablets have been translated is genuinely shocking. If you frame this as "you can help change that number," I feel agency.

### Barriers That Would Stop Me

**Intimidation factor.** I browse r/cuneiform occasionally. The level of expertise there is daunting. If your platform feels like it is for "real scholars" and I am just in the way, I will leave immediately.

**Unclear value proposition.** "Help transcribe cuneiform tablets" is too abstract. What am I actually doing? What happens to my work? Does anyone ever see it? If I cannot answer these questions in 30 seconds, I am out.

**Time commitment uncertainty.** If I do not know how long a task will take before I start, I will not start. I have 15 minutes before my kid wakes up. I need to know if that is enough time.

**Fear of doing it wrong.** What if I mess something up? What if I confidently click the wrong thing and some academic has to fix my mistakes? This anxiety is real.

**Jargon overload.** If your onboarding uses terms like "logogram," "determinative," or "Neo-Babylonian period" without explanation, you have lost me. I do not know what these mean and I do not have time to look them up.

## 2. Onboarding Experience

### What Would Feel Approachable

**Start with "why this matters."** Before you teach me anything, spend 30 seconds on the emotional hook. Show me a translated tablet that reveals something surprising about ancient life. Make me care.

**Immediately show me what I will actually be doing.** A screenshot or short video of the task interface. I need to visualize myself doing this before I commit to learning how.

**Tell me the time commitment upfront.** "Most users complete their first task in under 3 minutes" is the kind of statement that keeps me engaged.

**Acknowledge my ignorance.** Something like "You do not need to know anything about cuneiform to help. We will teach you exactly what you need to know." That is reassuring.

### What Would Feel Intimidating

**Long tutorials before doing anything.** If I have to watch a 10-minute video or read multiple screens of text before I can contribute, I will bookmark the site and never return.

**Quizzes or tests.** I am not in school. Do not make me feel like I am being evaluated before I can participate.

**Dense academic language.** Even well-intentioned explanations can feel exclusionary if they assume too much baseline knowledge.

**Registration walls before seeing the experience.** Let me try a sample task before asking for my email. Once I am hooked, I will happily sign up.

### How Much Training Is Too Much

**Maximum 2-3 minutes before first task.** I should be doing something useful within my first 5 minutes on the platform, including any initial explanation.

**Just-in-time learning over front-loaded training.** Teach me what I need to know exactly when I need to know it, not before.

**Make training optional and skippable for returning users.** If I come back tomorrow, do not make me sit through the same intro.

### Quick Wins to Build Confidence

**First task should be nearly impossible to fail.** Binary choices ("Does this look more like A or B?"), obvious visual matching, anything where success is almost guaranteed.

**Immediate positive feedback.** "You helped! This tablet is now 1% closer to being translated." Even if that number is somewhat artificial, it feels good.

**Show me what I just contributed to.** After my first task, show me the tablet I just helped with and what my contribution added.

---

## 3. Task Design Preferences

### Ideal Task Duration

**2-5 minutes is the sweet spot.** Long enough to feel substantive, short enough to fit into waiting rooms, lunch breaks, or pre-bedtime scrolling.

**10 minutes is my maximum for a single session.** Beyond that, I need a clear save point and the ability to return.

**Allow me to do "just one more."** If I am in a flow state, let me keep going. But never make me feel obligated to continue.

### Visual Versus Text-Based Tasks

**Visual tasks are far more accessible for beginners.** Pattern matching, shape recognition, comparing images. I can do this without knowing any cuneiform.

**Text-based tasks require more onboarding.** If I am reading transliterated text, I need to understand the notation system first. This is a higher barrier.

**Hybrid tasks with visual primary and text secondary.** Show me the tablet image prominently, with text as supporting context. Do not make me parse text I do not understand.

### Preference for Certainty Versus Ambiguity

**Start with high-certainty tasks.** Clear, obvious choices build confidence. Save the ambiguous cases for after I feel competent.

**When ambiguity is unavoidable, frame it explicitly.** "Experts disagree on this symbol too. What is your best guess?" That normalizes uncertainty rather than making me feel incompetent.

**Always provide an "I'm not sure" option.** Never force me to guess when I genuinely do not know. Let me skip without penalty.

**Show me when my uncertainty is valuable data.** "When multiple volunteers mark this as unclear, it gets flagged for expert review." Now my "I do not know" is actually useful.

### Feedback Loops and Progress Indicators

**Immediate feedback is essential.** After each task, tell me what happened. Did I agree with other volunteers? Was my answer incorporated?

**Cumulative progress tracking.** How many tasks have I completed? How many tablets have I contributed to? Show me numbers going up.

**Comparative context.** "You've contributed to 5 tablets this week. The average volunteer contributes to 3." This is motivating without being competitive.

**Milestone celebrations.** At 10, 50, 100 contributions, acknowledge me. Make it feel like an achievement.

---

## 4. Community and Recognition

### What Recognition Would Feel Meaningful

**Contribution counts on my profile.** I want to see my total impact, broken down in ways I understand (tablets contributed to, symbols identified, etc.).

**Attribution in outputs.** If a tablet I worked on eventually gets published or translated, I want to be in the credits somewhere, even as part of "X volunteers contributed."

**Shareable accomplishments.** Let me post to LinkedIn that I helped transcribe ancient Mesopotamian tablets. That is a good story.

**Expert acknowledgment.** If an actual Assyriologist reviews my work and sends even an automated "thanks for your contribution," that means something.

### What Recognition Would Not Matter

**Leaderboards.** I am not competing with other volunteers. This would actually turn me off. I am not here to "win."

**Badges for arbitrary achievements.** If the badge does not represent something I care about, it feels hollow.

**Points or currency systems.** I am not playing a game. Do not gamify this in ways that feel cheap.

### Social Features: Helpful or Distracting?

**Mostly distracting for me.** I am here to contribute, not to chat. Social features add complexity and potential for awkward interactions.

**Exception: Asynchronous Q&A.** If I can ask "What is this symbol?" and get an answer from someone more knowledgeable, that is useful. Real-time chat is not.

**Seeing other volunteers' work.** Anonymously seeing how others tackled the same task could be educational. But I do not need to interact with them directly.

**Expert access should be limited and structured.** I do not want to bother busy academics with beginner questions. But if there is a way to occasionally get expert input through the platform, that would be valuable.

### Connecting with Others

**I value connecting with the mission more than with people.** I want to feel connected to this global effort, but I do not need to make friends here.

**Community of practice, not community of socialization.** Share tips, techniques, and educational content. Skip the forums and profiles.

## 5. Trust and Understanding

### Communicating AI Uncertainty Without Causing Confusion

**Use visual indicators I can understand intuitively.** A confidence meter with green/yellow/red is clearer than percentages. "The AI is pretty confident about this" versus "The AI is guessing here" in plain language.

**Explain what uncertainty means for my task.** "When the AI is less confident, your input matters more. Take your time on this one."

**Do not show me raw probability scores.** "73.4% confidence" means nothing to me and feels like false precision.

**Normalize uncertainty.** "This is hard. Even experts would find this challenging." That makes me feel less bad about being unsure.

### What Context and Education Is Actually Useful

**Task-relevant context only.** If I am identifying a symbol, tell me about that symbol. Do not give me a history of the Neo-Assyrian Empire unless it directly helps me complete the task.

**Progressive disclosure.** Show me the minimum first. Let me click to learn more if I am interested.

**Practical examples over abstract explanations.** "This symbol looks like a triangle with lines. It usually represents the word for 'king'" is better than "This is a logographic representation in the cuneiform syllabary."

**Historical tidbits as rewards, not requirements.** After I complete a task, you can tell me something interesting about what I just worked on. Do not make me read it before I can continue.

### What Context Would Be Overwhelming

**Academic citations and references.** I do not need to know which 1978 paper established the standard transliteration.

**Comprehensive historical background.** Save the history lessons for people who opt in.

**Linguistic terminology.** Every field has jargon. Translate yours into plain language.

**Edge cases and exceptions.** Teach me the common patterns first. I will encounter edge cases later.

### When Would I Feel I Am Making a Real Contribution?

**When I can trace my input to an outcome.** "Your identification of this symbol matched 4 other volunteers and was incorporated into the transcription." That is concrete.

**When I contribute to tablets that eventually get translated.** Even if it takes years, knowing that tablets I worked on are now readable is meaningful.

**When my uncertainty data is explicitly valued.** "Your 'not sure' responses helped identify areas needing expert review on 3 tablets." That reframes hesitation as contribution.

**When I am part of the percentage change.** "Together, volunteers have helped increase the percentage of transcribed tablets from 5% to 6%." Even small aggregate progress feels real.

## 6. Practical Recommendations

### Features That Would Increase My Contribution Frequency

**Mobile-first design.** I am more likely to contribute from my phone while waiting for coffee than from my laptop at a desk.

**Offline capability or at least graceful offline handling.** If I start a task and lose connection, do not lose my progress.

**Session resumption.** If I was halfway through something yesterday, let me pick up exactly where I left off.

**"Daily contribution" reminders that respect boundaries.** One gentle notification per day maximum. Let me set my own schedule.

**Quick-start option.** "Do one quick task" that jumps straight to a simple contribution without any preamble.

**Variety in task types.** If I get bored with one kind of task, let me try a different kind.

**Clear stopping points.** Tell me "Good stopping point! You've completed this section." Do not guilt me into "just one more."

### Deal-Breakers That Would Cause Abandonment

**Mandatory account creation before trying.** I will not give you my email until I know this is worth my time.

**Long loading times.** If your tablet images take more than 3 seconds to load, I am gone.

**Confusing interface.** If I cannot figure out what to click within 10 seconds, I am closing the tab.

**No indication of progress.** If I do 10 tasks and have no idea if they mattered, I will not do 11.

**Feeling stupid.** If the platform makes me feel ignorant or incompetent, I will not return.

**Bugs that lose my work.** If I complete a task and it does not save, I will never trust the platform again.

**Overly aggressive gamification.** Streaks, lives, or anything that feels like a mobile game trying to addict me.

**Too much friction between tasks.** If there are multiple screens of confirmation or loading between each task, the flow breaks.

### Mobile Versus Desktop Considerations

**Mobile is where I have time.** Waiting rooms, transit, before bed. These are my available minutes.

**Desktop is where I would go deep.** If I get really interested and want to learn more or do more complex tasks, I might sit down at a computer. But start with mobile.

**Touch-friendly interfaces are essential.** If I need pixel-precision clicking on a phone, it will not work.

**Tablet images must scale well.** These are visual artifacts. If I cannot see the details on a phone screen, mobile contribution is impossible.

**Consider landscape mode for detailed work.** Let me rotate my phone and get a wider view of the tablet.

## Summary: Make It Easy or I Will Leave

I represent hundreds of thousands of potential contributors who have good intentions, limited time, and no specialized knowledge. We want to help, but we will not fight through barriers to do so.

**The first 5 minutes determine everything.** If I feel welcomed, capable, and useful in my first session, I will come back. If I feel confused, inadequate, or unsure of my impact, I will not.

**Respect my time constraints.** I am not an academic with hours to dedicate. I have 10 minutes before a meeting. Let me be useful in 10 minutes.

**Meet me at my level.** Do not assume I know anything about cuneiform. Explain everything in plain language. Make me feel smart, not stupid.

**Show me my impact.** I need to see that my contributions matter. Numbers, progress bars, attribution, anything that makes the abstract feel concrete.

**Make it feel different from social media.** I am trying to escape addictive, empty engagement patterns. Give me depth and meaning instead.

If you build this right, you will not just get my 20 hours of volunteer time per year. You will get my Saturday mornings when I would otherwise be scrolling Twitter. That is a much bigger prize.
