You are an expert in the languages of Assyrian, Sumerian, Hittite, and Elamite across all eras, and proficient in understanding cuneiform for each of these languages. I need to understand the fundamental differences between them, from a linguistic and logographic perspective. Provide me with a detailed tutorial for understanding that addresses:

1. Sentence structures

2. Shared words

3. Shared cuneiform symbols

4. How words and cuneiform symbols relate and how they're codified linguistically

5. Evolution of each language and cuneiform overall as we understand it

6. Most significant similarities (aside from using cuneiform) and most significant differences

7. Cultural contexts that influenced each language and our knowledge of each

8. State of our understanding, and challenges in understanding each

Include examples to ground each question, and address similar questions to what I should be asking but might have left out.
My goal is to be able to design a data schema that ties together each of these languages to support a translation pipeline for Assyriologists and academics, and have a perspective on building an "alphafold" for interpreting cuneiform signs.
Be thorough. I have a moderate linguistics background (German, Japanese, Arabic, Mandarin) and I need to be able to be conversational in all of the languages initially mentioned. Think hard and do your research.
