# Status: Implemented into v2 schema.

## 9 new tables + modifications:

scholars — identity layer with ORCID, institution, expertise
annotation_runs — 3 new columns: scholar_id, method, publication_ref
tokens — stripped to positional anchor (removed form, reading, sign_function, damage, reading_confidence)
token_readings — competing transliterations per token position
4 evidence tables with real FKs (token_reading_evidence, lemmatization_evidence, sign_annotation_evidence, translation_evidence)
3 decision tables with real FKs and supersedes chains (token_reading_decisions, lemmatization_decisions, translation_decisions)
4 new migration steps added

## Schema Update Summary
### Changes
9 new tables, 3 new columns on annotation_runs, 5 columns moved off tokens into token_readings
Table count: ~27 (v1) → ~36 (v2 pre-trust) → ~45 (v2 with trust)
The 9 trust tables are structurally repetitive but simple (5-7 columns each, all with real FKs)
### Tradeoffs
Tokens store reading data? No — always join to token_readings. Single source of truth; avoids staleness. Chose over cached consensus on token.
Polymorphic FKs? No — separate tables per entity type. Real FK enforcement for a multi-user scholarly system. Chose over one flexible evidence_links table.
Scholar identity? Dedicated scholars table. Prevents "J. Smith" vs "John Smith" at scale. Chose over freetext scholar_name.
Evidence/decision scope? 4 evidence + 3 decision tables (7 total). Database-enforced integrity; self-documenting. Chose over 2 polymorphic tables.

### What This Enables
Every reading, lemmatization, sign annotation, and translation can now answer:

Who said this?
How did they determine it?
What evidence supports it?
Who chose it as consensus, and why?
What did it replace?
