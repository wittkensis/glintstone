    The canonical cuneiform sign inventory. Every sign has a name, possible readings
    (values), Unicode codepoint, and GDL structural description. This is the Rosetta Stone
    linking physical signs to linguistic readings. CDL corpus data references OGSL via OIDs.

      This is sign polyvalence — one sign, many readings. The v2 schema needs
      context rules for when each reading applies (language, period, genre, function).
      OGSL lists them all without context.

sign_list_alignment:
  description: >
    Multiple sign numbering systems exist. OGSL uses names. Other sources use numbers.
    A concordance table is needed to link them.
  systems:
    OGSL: Sign names (A, AN, DU3). Used by ORACC corpus data.
    MZL: Borger's MesZL numbers (integers). Used by CompVis annotations.
    ABZ: Borger's ABZ numbers (integers). Used by eBL annotations.
    Unicode: U+12000 range. Used for display.
    LAK: Deimel's LAK numbers. Used in archaic sign studies.
    REC: Thureau-Dangin numbers. Older scholarship.
  notes: >
    No single source provides a complete concordance. The v2 schema should include
    a sign_concordance table mapping between all numbering systems.

v2_schema_notes: >
  OGSL is the foundation of the Graphemic layer. Key gaps vs v2 proposal:
  - No period/region information (sign forms change over 3000 years)
  - No frequency data per reading (can't determine "most common" reading)
  - No function classification per reading (logographic vs syllabographic vs determinative)
  - No sign-form images (physical appearance varies by era and scribal school)
  - Values list is flat — no context for when each reading applies
